3.  If you have it installed already, you may check it by running `java -version` in your terminal.
4.  Download the latest `.jar` file from here(https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-F11-2/tp/releases/tag/v2.0).
5.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **O\$P$ budget tracking app** ðŸ™‚.

7.  Type the command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it.
8.  **Example:** Typing `help` and pressing **Enter** will open a mini window showing a list of all possible commands.

### Manage Expenses

#### Add an expense: `add`

- **Format:** `add/<title>/<date>/<amount>`

Add an expense with a title, description, date, amount. You have to first enter
the `add` keyword, followed by the `title`, `date` and `amount`, each separated by a `/`.

After that, you will be prompted to optionally add a `description` of maximum 200 characters.
Please ensure the description is accurate and simple, because the summary analytics by category uses description to classify expenses.
Please ensure the description is not wordy and it is to the point, to ensure your expenses are accurately classified.
Please also ensure that the description does not contain conflicting categories.

- **Example Usage:**

```
Had lunch with friends
```

- **Example Usage:**

```
Went to the movies with friends
```

The `date` field has to follow the DD-MM-YYYY format. You can choose the date to be in the past (earliest 2000),
present and future, as long as it is a legitimate date (e.g. NOT 99-99-9999).

Once the expense has been added, it is unsettled. Typing `list-unsettled` will allow you to view
your newly added expense, just like `list`.

The `amount` can be entered as a whole number or floating-point number. The result will be rounded off to 2 decimal
places. The `amount` is capped at 50,000SGD or its equivalent if your expenses are in another currency.

- **Example Usage:**

```
add/breakfast/23-08-2002/10.00
```

- **Output:**

```
Enter the description (press Enter to skip):
```

If you choose to add a description within 200 characters:

```
Expense added successfully:
Title: breakfast
Description: McDonald's
Date: 23-08-2002
Amount: 10.00
```

If you skip the description part, the description field will be replaced with 'nil':

```
Expense added successfully:
Title: breakfast
Description: nil
Date: 23-08-2002
Amount: 10.00
```

The entry will automatically be tagged with a unique expense ID.

You are not allowed to add an expense containing a `title` of an expense that already exists.

---

#### Edit an expense: `edit`

Edit an existing expense. Follows the same constraints and parameter-filling procedure as the `add` command.

- **Format:** `edit/<expense ID>/<new title>/<new date>/<new amount>`

If you do not wish to change the `title`, `date` or/and `amount`, type `X` (both lowercase and uppercase accepted)
in the respective fields. Suppose you only want to change the `amount`:

- **Example Usage:**

```
edit/1/x/X/10
```

- **Output:**

```
Enter the description (press Enter to skip):
```

If you choose to change the description within 200 characters:

```
Expense edited successfully:
Title: breakfast
Description: Technoedge Canteen
Date: 23-08-2002
Amount: 10.00
```

If you choose to keep the current description:

```
Expense added successfully:
Title: breakfast
Description: McDonald's
Date: 23-08-2002
Amount: 10.00
```

---

#### Delete an expense: `delete`

Delete an expense followed by the desired expense index to remove it from the `list`.
You will see the title, description, date and amount of the to-be-deleted expense and
be prompted to confirm the deletion.

Expense ID is 1-index, so to delete your second expense, type `delete/2`.

- **Format:** `delete/<expense ID>`

- **Example Usage:**

```
delete/1
```

- **Output:**

```
Are you sure you want to delete this expense? (y/n)
Title: breakfast
Description: Technoedge Canteen
Date: 23-08-2002
Amount: 10.00
```

Typing 'n' (both lowercase and uppercase accepted) aborts the function.

```
Deletion aborted.
```

Typing 'y' (both lowercase and uppercase accepted) will display the title, description, date and amount of the to-be-deleted expense
and execute the delete function.

```
Updated owed amounts written to file successfully.
